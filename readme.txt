An intermediate GameMaker: Studio tutorial project source code.

This is a two-player (easily extended to 4 if desired) local multiplayer platformer engine created in 50 minutes in a YouTube tutorial. (link)

Gravity, jump strength, number of extra jumps, etc are all defined as constants in Create and are easily modified. Your own idle, run, jump, and fall sprites can be added and used to replace the ones referenced in the platformer Create and End Step methods. 

You can resize the spr_hitbox to match the size of your new sprites and will work appropriately. Make sure you center them all.
